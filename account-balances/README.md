# Understanding this project

This project has a function called `handleEvent`. It uses an `EventHandler` which is defined in the manifest file (project.yaml) as "kind: substrate/EventHandler"

The `schema.graphql` file defines the variables blockHeight which is mandatory and of type Int.

If we examine the function `handleEvent` in more detail, you can see that this function takes one argument of type SubstrateEvent. It then creates a new instance of Account passing in the `event.extrinsic.block.block.header.hash` argument as a string and assigning this to the variable record.

Next, the account is converted to a string via `toString()` and assigned to `record.account`. The balance is type cast as Balance and converted to a big integer.
